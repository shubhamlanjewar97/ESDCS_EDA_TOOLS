## Installation Options on Windows

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Option 1: Preinstalled Ubuntu Image (If RAM >= 8GB && Disk Space > 25 GB you can go with this option. Otherwise go to option 2)

#### Step 1: Download and Install VirtualBox
Download from: [VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

#### Step 2: Download .ova file (Open Virtualization Archive format)

Download the `.ova` file for preinstalled apps from 

Either this Google Drive Link(generally faster): [![Google Drive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Drive-34A853?logo=googledrive&logoColor=white)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_P-tEtRUpTZADc26KuqlRG38UXV6wA_J/view?usp=sharing)

OR  from One Drive Link: [![OneDrive](https://img.shields.io/badge/OneDrive-blue?logo=microsoft-onedrive&logoColor=white)](https://indianinstituteofscience-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/shubhaml_iisc_ac_in/Eb3L3PkAOZBMtYQH9pJAQqsBrpyRsw5gBYMe7jH5dtrj4g?e=DRUdzv)  

For OpenRoad, download the .ova file from Annexure B. (This is optional. You won't need this for course assignments and project. We shall tell more about it in the Lab session)

#### Step 3: Import Appliance in VirtualBox
1. Open **VirtualBox**  
2. Go to **File ‚Üí Import Appliance**  
3. In **Source**, select the downloaded `.ova` file  
4. In **Settings**, select the path where you want to keep the Ubuntu files  
   - If OS drive has less space than **25 GB**, prefer another drive  
   - Preferably choose a **faster drive** for better performance  
   - You can also adjust **RAM, CPU cores, and other resources** here if needed  
5. Click **Finish** ‚Üí Import will take some time

#### Step 4: Start and Use Ubuntu VM
- Start the imported VM from VirtualBox  
- Credentials:  
  - **Username**: `esdcs`  
  - **Password**: `esdcs#123`
    
It has preinstalled tools (iverilog, gtkwave, opensta, yosys). It also has folders `NANGATE_OPEN_STDCELL` and `tutorials` at location /home/esdcs/. 




#### Step 5: Other few setups

To setup **shared folders** and to do **other few setups**, you can go through `Step 7` onwards of `Option 3 : Installing Ubuntu 22.04.5 in VirtualBox`.
Same steps are followed in the following video from timestamp 7:58 onwards.

[![Watch on YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Watch%20Now-red?logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://youtu.be/qvrV6PENzNk)


#### Step 1: Enable WSL and Install Ubuntu 22.04.5
Open CMD or PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
```

Restart if prompted.

#### Step 2: Open Ubuntu (WSL shell)
From the **Start Menu**, search and open **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**, or run the following command in CMD:

```powershell
wsl
```

#### Step 3: Install EDA Tools
Inside Ubuntu shell:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y iverilog yosys opensta gtkwave 
```

#### Step 4: Verify installation
```bash
iverilog -V
yosys -V
sta -help
gtkwave -h
lsb_release -a
```

(Mandatory : Please refer Annexure A for required folders)  

#### Notes

- To see the list of installed WSL distributions:
 ```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```
- To remove a WSL distribution:  
 ```powershell
wsl --unregister Ubuntu
```
- Access Windows files inside WSL at `/mnt/c/...`.

# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Apple_logo_grey.svg" alt="Apple Logo" width="25"/> EDA Tools Installation ‚Äî macOS 15.6 Sequoia

Here, we will install: **iverilog** (Verilog simulator), **yosys** (Logic synthesis tool), **opensta** (Static timing analysis), **Surfer** (Waveform viewer - used instead of GTKWave)  

---
## Installation Steps
üì∫ **Video Walkthrough:** [EDA Tools Installation on macOS](https://youtu.be/3GBMIc1RFXI)  
[![Watch on YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Watch%20Now-red?logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://youtu.be/3GBMIc1RFXI)

### Step 1: Install Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is the package manager for macOS.  
Install it by running this in your terminal: (You can skip this step if Homebrew is already installed)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

---

### Step 2: Install Surfer (Waveform Viewer)
Instead of GTKWave, we will use **Surfer**. To install it, enter the following brew command:

```bash
brew install surfer
```
---

### Step 3: Install Docker Desktop
We will use the other 3 tools (iverilog, yosys, opensta) in a Linux environment using Docker.

Download and install Docker Desktop for Mac (For **Intel Macs** ‚Üí use Intel version, for **Apple Silicon Macs** ‚Üí use Apple version ):  
üëâ [Docker Desktop Download Link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)

After installation:  
1. Launch **Docker Desktop** from Applications.  
2. Log in with your **Docker Hub** account [Simply login with google works].  

---

### Step 4: Prepare Workspace Directory
Workspace directory will be shared directory between macOS and docker Ubuntu 22.04.5. Which means contents at this path present in macOS will be accessible in Ubuntu and vice versa. 
Create such directory to store Docker-related files (Please change the path according to your needs):

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please replace `/Users/shubhamlanjewar/code/esdcs_docker` with **`your_path`**

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/shubhamlanjewar/code/esdcs_docker
```

---

### Step 5: Download and load Docker Image

Download the Docker image tar file.

For Apple Silicon: `esdcs-ubuntu-img.tar` [esdcs-ubuntu-img.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qZJMRKNXvw5iDqVb7cYXbC5-fPgOxV6w/view?usp=sharing)  
For Intel Processor: `esdcs-ubuntu-img-intel.tar` [esdcs-ubuntu-img-intel.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10NArIqpWZQnXYdUfpdW8AeEayYwmeTc3/view?usp=sharing)  

This Docker image contains:  
- **Ubuntu** (22.04.5 LTS), **Preinstalled tools** (iverilog, yosys, opensta, lsb_release, git, curl, vim, sudo, bash)
- **tutorials & NANGATE_OPEN_STDCEL**: Its present at same location as mentioned in Tutorial PDF ( /home/esdcs/)

To load the Docker image (for Apple silicon), go to the location where `.tar` file is present and run:
```bash
docker load -i esdcs-ubuntu-img.tar
```
alternatively, you can use the following command(only for Apple silicon), in this case, you won't need the .tar file (we are pulling the image from DockerHub account):
```bash
docker pull shubhamlanjewar97/esdcs-ubuntu-img:latest
```


For Intel processor, run:
```bash
docker load -i esdcs-ubuntu-img-intel.tar
```


---

### Step 6: Create and Run the Docker Container (First Time Only)
Run the container for the very first time:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please replace `/Users/shubhamlanjewar/code/esdcs_docker` with **`your_path`**

For Apple Silicon:
```bash
docker run -it --name esdcs-ubuntu   -v /Users/shubhamlanjewar/code/esdcs_docker:/macos_local   esdcs-ubuntu-img
```

For Intel processor:
```bash
docker run -it --name esdcs-ubuntu-intel   -v /Users/shubhamlanjewar/code/esdcs_docker:/macos_local   esdcs-ubuntu-img-intel
```

This will take you to the Linux environment with user "esdcs". This Linux environment is running inside Docker.

(Mandatory: Please refer to Annexure C for more Docker commands)  

‚úÖ You will now be inside a Linux environment with **iverilog**, **yosys**, and **opensta** already installed.


### Note:
**iverilog, yosys, and opensta** are in the docker environment, however **surfer** is installed in the macOS environment. Make sure you are on the correct terminal to use the respective tools.


Since we already know that our workspace directory is shared between macOS (`/Users/shubhamlanjewar/code/esdcs_docker` here) and docker Ubuntu 22.04.5 (`/macos_local` here), once the `.vcd` file is generated in Ubuntu 22.04.5 environment, we can copy to `/macos_local` in Ubuntu and then go to macOS terminal (e.g. `/Users/shubhamlanjewar/code/esdcs_docker`) and use surfer to view waveforms using the following command:

```bash
surfer test.vcd
```

---

### üîπ Annexure C: Useful Docker Commands(Mandatory)

List Docker containers(this also shows the status of containers also e.g. exited, etc):
[For Intel processors, use `esdcs-ubuntu-img-intel` instead of `esdcs-ubuntu-img`.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Start the container (next time onwards):
```bash
docker start -ai esdcs-ubuntu
```

Stop the container:
```bash
docker stop esdcs-ubuntu
```

Remove a container:
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please use with caution! It will remove all data in the Docker container.
```bash
docker rm <container_name>
# Example:
docker rm esdcs-ubuntu
```
